# Mother: The Video Game
## Introduction
An in-depth video game for the Game Boy Advance

Mother: The Video Game was developed in Spring 2019 as the final project for a Media Device Architecture class at Georgia Tech. It was written in C and compiled into the Game Boy Advance emulator visualboyadvance-m, which can be dowloaded <a href="https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m/releases">here</a> (in the assets section). The game features three separate levels - focused on three different characters - that have their own gameplay mechanics and goals.
